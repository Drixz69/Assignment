    <h2>About Peter</h2>
    <p>Welcome! I am Peter Peabody, a fully qualified Approved Driving Instructor (ADI) based in Basingstoke. I previously worked for a large national driving school, gaining years of experience teaching pupils of all ages, from 17-year-old beginners to mature learners.</p>
    <p>I have now gone freelance to offer a more personal, flexible, and affordable service to my local community. My goal is not just to help you pass your test, but to make you a safe driver for life.</p>

    <h2>The Car & Facilities</h2>
    <p>You will be learning in a modern, manual transmission vehicle that is fully insured for learner drivers. For your safety and peace of mind, the car is equipped with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>He-Man Dual Controls:</strong> Ensuring I can intervene safely if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Air Conditioning:</strong> Keeping you cool and focused during lessons.</li>
        <li><strong>Dash Cams:</strong> For insurance and reviewing driving scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
